## Motivation:
The motivation behind this project stems from my deep passion for travel and exploration. I have always been fascinated by the opportunity to discover new places, experience diverse cultures, and gain fresh perspectives. That curiosity about travel eventually sparked a deeper question for me like beyond personal joy what role does tourism play in the bigger picture especially economically?
That question inspired this deep dive into U.S. tourism dynamics.



## Questions:
1) Analyze and identify seasonal visitation patterns for different national parks between 2018 and 2023, and understand trends and patterns in visitor behavior across various seasons?
2) Contributions to economic growth and the levels of real output by tourism commodities in the U.S. from 2018 to 2023, and how have these metrics varied across different commodities over this period?
3) Contributions to economic growth and levels of direct employment across various tourism industries in the U.S. and how have these metrics evolved over the period?
4) Industries that have the largest impact on employment opportunities for tourism in relation to overall industry growth or contraction.



## Known Issues and Challenges
1.	Data from different sources may have varying formats or levels of granularity, making it challenging to create a unified analysis. 
2.	Some datasets have missing values or gaps in coverage. 
3.	Data comes from various platforms with its own standards and methodologies for data collection, making it difficult to merge the data seamlessly.


## Technologies Used
1) Python / Pandas - for exploration, normalizing and aggregation of the dataset
2) Tableau - for creating interactive dashboard
3) PowerPoint - for introduction of Project
4) Git - for version control

## Data Sources
To answer the above questions I used the following sources to collect datasets for my analysis

1) National Park Service Visitor Statistics-

## Conclusion
Tourism plays a vital role in the U.S. economy, consistently making a significant contribution to the national GDP. Although the industry faced major disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been steadily recovering since 2021. Visitation peaks in the summer months of June through August, reflecting strong seasonal patterns, particularly in national park tourism. Additionally, the sector supports a large share of service-related jobs, especially in hospitality, recreation, and transportation.
